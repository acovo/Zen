**General**  
Zen Music Player is developed and maintained by only one developer.  
This Privacy Policy aims to describe how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.  
By using Zen, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

**Information being collected**  
For better user experience, Zen collects log data in cases of error or app crashes and reports them automatically (**Users can opt out of automatic reporting from app's settings**). 
Log data may include information such as the brand and model of device used, the operating system version and other statistics. 
Zen uses Firebase Crashlytics for enabling the log reporting service. Read about it [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) and [here](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics-app-distribution-data-processing-terms).

**How is the information used**  
The reported log data is used to fix bugs or any other technical issues that may occur and improve Zen.

**Disclosure of your information**  
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers such as Firebase Crashlytics.

**Your Choices**  
You may opt out of the automatic reporting of crash logs data through Firebase Crashlytics by disabling the feature in the app's settings. 
However, please note that this may impact our ability to provide certain features and services.

**Changes to the Policy**  
If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
